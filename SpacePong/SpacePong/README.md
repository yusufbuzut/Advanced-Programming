Term project source codes will go thru automatic code similarity check. If you code yourself, (that is, no copy-paste),  there should not be a significant similarity with others or with programs available in the internet.  There could be small simialr sections where java swing library API - that's ok. But overall source code, it logic and structure will not be siginificanly similar if you don't copy-paste code. Mae sure you provide references to resources that you got inspired for solution/implementation.
