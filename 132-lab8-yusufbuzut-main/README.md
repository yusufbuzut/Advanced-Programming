# LAB8 PRELAB

COMP 132 – Advanced Programming  
Pre-Laboratory Assignment 8 
Files and Regular Expressions 

### Collaboration Rules
This lab  is an individual work. Everyone should submit their own work. You can use any material from the course, or any other resource on Java programming language. You can discuss lecture related topics, the problem at the concept level with other students, but not the solution. You can reuse (copy-paste) code from the lecture notes, textbook, or code given in the lab, but not from others (internet sources, other students etc.)

### Honor Code - by submitting lab work I accept:
- This code is my own work. 
- I did not consult to any program written other students. 
- I did not search for the solution of the problem in the internet.
- I did not copy-paste code written by others.
- This code is my own work.

### IMPORTANT

* DON'T COPY PASTE code from anybody or any other resource. The code should be written by you. The code similarity tools will find such codes and disciplinary action will be taken.
* You should solve the problem the way we described. By not following instructions, you may lose points.
* Check Blackboard LAB6 for possible corrections.
* Print out in the same format, points will be taken off, if you don't print in the same format.
* It is normal for you get "cannot be resolved" type of errors when you first import your project from Github because all classes are not implemented yet. You will resolve these errors as you create and implement the necessary classes.
* Don't forget to implement setters and getters of the private variables.
* Pay attention to use the appropriate access modifier for instance variables and methods.
